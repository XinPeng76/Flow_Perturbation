# Flow_Perturbation
We introduce the flow perturbation method, which incorporates optimized stochastic perturbations into the flow. By reweighting trajectories generated by the perturbed flow, our method achieves
unbiased sampling of the Boltzmann distribution with orders of magnitude speedup compared to both brute force
Jacobian calculations and the Hutchinson estimator.
